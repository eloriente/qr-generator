### Description of the project
The project was born with the idea of being able to generate QR codes in a simple way and that allows you to download subject to a series of easy configuration options, avoiding as much as possible to send the data to servers so that there is no information traffic.

### Technologies
The project has been created with:
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as a packager.
- [React](https://react.dev/) as core web technology.
- [StyleComponents](https://styled-components.com/) for the generation of dynamic components and themes.
- [ReactRouterDom](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) for web pagination management.
- [QrCode.React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qrcode.react) for the generation of QR images and figures.
